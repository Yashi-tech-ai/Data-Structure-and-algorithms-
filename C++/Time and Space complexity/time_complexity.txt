 time complexity = the rate at which the time taken increases with respect to input size
 big O notation 
 Can be ignored in time complexity := 
/* always compute worst case scenario
   avoid constants
   avoid lower values in expression */


Space complexity = space taken that is memory occupied 
= big o notaion 
= auxilary space {space used to solve the problem } + input space
